JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. 
It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which 
Java byte code can be executed. 
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages 
and compiled to Java byte code.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration 
of each OS is different from each other.
However, Java is platform independent. 
There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

    Loads code
    Verifies code
    Executes code
    Provides runtime environment
 
 
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. 
It is also written as Java RTE. 
The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools 
which are used for developing Java applications. 
It is used to provide the runtime environment. 
It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. 
It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.
