JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. 
It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which 
Java byte code can be executed. 
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages 
and compiled to Java byte code.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
